## üìù Question Set: Limitations of Excel

1. I'm trying to perform an analysis of school data that combines two data sets: test scores (a csv) and poverty data (an Excel file). I'm combining these datasets using the school's 10-digit code, which is usually something like `4534001`. After my merge, though, around 10% of my schools disappear. What could should I check about the data, and how can I fix the issue?
2. I received a document from the Brazilian government in response to a freedom of information request. The spreadsheet mostly looks good, but some of the names have a problem and look like Ant‚ñ°nia or M„Ç´rcia. What might be going wrong, and how could I fix the issue?
3. You're working on a true crime podcast, so I send you a dataset of every unsolved murder in the USA since the 1960s. Are you able to open it in Excel? Why or why not?
